<p>Virtual reality, or VR, is the newest and potentially the most efficient
dimension of media. One of the important components of creating a
virtual experience is simulating the vision. And for simulating vision,
one should know the user’s field of view at any given time. The field of
view is in turn determined by the position and orientation of user’s
head. A few companies have provided some solutions to the head tracking
problem. Among them <a href="https://www.oculus.com/en-us/dk2/">Oculus</a> is one of the most workable solutions which uses
infrared LEDs on the headset for tracking. Their system is, however,
expensive!</p>

<h1>
<a id="system-overview" class="anchor" href="#system-overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>System overview</h1>

<p>Here, we describe a cost efficient solution to head tracking. It only
requires a color-printed sheet of paper and a commodity smartphone. In
the proposed system, a printed pattern is tracked using the smartphone
camera to estimate its position and orientation. The estimated position
and orientation are then sent back to the headset via bluetooth. The
headset in turn renders a virtual scene from a desired viewpoint
relative to the user’s head. High efficiency and accuracy are two of the
main characteristics of our system that makes it viable.</p>

<p>The main components of the proposed systems are</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pattern design</p></li>
<li><p>Detector/tracker design</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple pattern registration</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="pattern-design" class="anchor" href="#pattern-design" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pattern design</h2>

<p>The six patterns used in our system are shown in the figure
above. Note that the only difference between the different
patterns is on their border. Different patterns have different grid
blocks with black outer border and this difference is what is used to
identify different patterns. These borders are specifically placed with
good error tolerance using error correcting codes.</p>

<p>The color grid pattern itself is designed by exhaustively searching for
all possible combinations of red, green and blue colors on a grid of
size 4 x 4 for quick and accurate detection.</p>

<h2>
<a id="detectortracker-design" class="anchor" href="#detectortracker-design" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Detector/Tracker design</h2>

<p>The pattern is detected by fast detection of corners in the image which
contain all the three colors used e.g. red, green and blue. It uses a
highly optimized coarse to fine algorithm implementation for precise
detection of corners. Note that all the 9 interior corners of the grid
pattern have all the three colors surrounding them.</p>

<p>We avoid running (relatively) expensive pattern detection algorithm in
each frame of video captured by the camera by predicting the position of
the corners in the next frame and then confining the search for corners
to a small region. The well known Kalman filter is also used to smoothen
the pattern trajectory.</p>

<h2>
<a id="multiple-pattern-registration" class="anchor" href="#multiple-pattern-registration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Multiple pattern registration</h2>

<p>In order to be able to track the user’s head with a single camera,
multiple patterns are required to be placed on the headset in case one
of the patterns is highly oblique to the camera. To achieve this,
relative position and orientation of different patterns is estimated.</p>

<h1>
<a id="operation" class="anchor" href="#operation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Operation</h1>

<p>In this Section we shall describe the procedure to operate the system
with varying degree of control on the system. First we shall describe
the simplest way to run the system using the provided .apk files.</p>

<p>Following are the minimum set of items required to operate the proposed
system:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Tracker phone: Galaxy S6</p></li>
<li><p>VR headset: GearVR with a smartphone (VR phone)</p></li>
<li><p>Printed patterns: Cardboard/foamboard cutouts with patterns pasted</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As more control is required on the system, additional software will be
required.</p>

<h2>
<a id="direct-installation" class="anchor" href="#direct-installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Direct installation</h2>

<p>Following are the instructions to directly operate the system without
installation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install the Tracker apk [PatternTracker.apk] available in the "Executables" folder  on the Tracker phone.</p></li>
<li><p>Install VR apk [TrackerGearVR.apk] available in the "Executables" folder on a the VR phone.</p></li>
<li><p>Pair Tracker phone and VR phone via bluetooth.</p></li>
<li><p>Print the six patterns shown in the figure above as described
in “Pattern printing instructions" below</p></li>
<li><p>Attach the Pattern 0 on the front side of VR headset and any number
of the remaining patterns on other parts of the VR headset. See
figure above.</p></li>
<li><p>Start the PatternTracker.apk on Tracker phone. Place this phone
horizontally so that the “Debug:on" button is on top left corner and
the back-facing camera facing towards the user. See Figure
above. Place it appropriately so that the
GearVR is comfortably in the field of view.</p></li>
<li><p>Start the app on the VR phone and put it in GearVR.</p></li>
<li><p>Optionally, register the multiple patterns. See details below.</p></li>
<li><p>Optionally, click the “Debug:on" button to turn it to “Debug:off"
which will enhance the performance of the system but will stop
showing the corner indicator.</p></li>
<li><p>Wear GearVR and try to move back and forth, and left and right to
notice that your view in VR is adjusting according to your motion.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamsungVR/PatternTracker/master/Documents/images/updateGeomOn.jpg" alt="update geometry on" width="800px" height="440px"><br>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamsungVR/PatternTracker/master/Documents/images/updateGeomOff.jpg" alt="update geometry off" width="800px" height="440px"><br>
Tracker phone with “update geometry" feature off.</p>

<p>Following are the instructions for registering multiple patterns:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Click the “Update Geom: off" button so that it show “Update Geom:
on"</p></li>
<li><p>Place the camera of the Tracker phone so that the Pattern 0 and one
of the other patterns are in view as seen on its screen and capture
good portion -more than half- of the screen. Make sure the lighting
is good.</p></li>
<li><p>See the corner indicators appear on the screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the corner indicators are stable i.e. not coming on and going
off frequently, press the “Update Geom: on” button again to turn it
into “Update Geom: off". Notice that below the buttons, each new
detected pattern will be listed. This shows that the new pattern has
been registered with the assumption that Pattern 0 was
already registered. See figure above where
Pattern 3 is registered with Pattern 0.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow steps 1 through 4 for registering each new pattern given the
already registered patterns. E.g. if in the last step Pattern 1 was
registered, in order to register Pattern 2 place the Tracker phone so
that either Pattern 0 and Pattern 2 are in view or Pattern 1 and
Pattern 2 are in view and then follow steps 2 through 3.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Pattern printing instructions on windows machine:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open a pattern image among those available at PatternDesign\patterns in windows photo viewer;</p></li>
<li><p>Print image in letter paper, 3.5x5in, four images in a page,
un-check “fit to frame”. Size of printed pattern should be 10.6cm
wide and 7.1cm high. See figure above.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In case the system crashes, one reason is that the opengl libraries on
phone are incompatible with the ones provided with the system. To
resolve this issue, the Tracker phone apk will need to be compiled again
as described in Section below.</p>

<h2>
<a id="project-compilation" class="anchor" href="#project-compilation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project compilation</h2>

<p>First, we shall describe the compilation of Tracker apk. The compilation
requires that the following are already installed on the computer:
latest Android SDK, Android NDK r10b, Eclipse. See <a href="http://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/setup.html">http://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/setup.html</a> for
reference. Also, OpenCV 2.4.9 for Android, available at <a href="http://opencv.org/downloads.html">http://opencv.org/downloads.html</a>, needs
to be installed on the system.</p>

<p>To compile the project, first import the project in Eclipse as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Browse to File&gt;Import&gt;Android&gt;Existing Android Code
Into Workspace.</p></li>
<li><p>Browse to the folder containing PatternTracker project.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the “PatternTracker" project and click “Finish".</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Similarly import the OpenCV Librar - 2.4.9 from the downloaded OpenCV
folder. And also the BluetoothLibrary from the corresponding
folder.</p>

<p>Now we need to add the required libraries in the project as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Select the PatternTracker project in Eclipse on the left panel</p></li>
<li><p>Go to Project&gt;Properties&gt;Android.</p></li>
<li><p>In the bottom right “Library" section, remove any existing libraries</p></li>
<li><p>Click “Add" and add the OpenCV and the Bluetooth libraries.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit the “include C:/.../OpenCV.mk" line in the Android.mk file
present inside the jni folder in the PatternTracker android project
and modify it appropriately to provide the directory where the
OpenCV is installed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Set the ndk compiler as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Select the PatternTracker project in Eclipse on the left panel</p></li>
<li><p>Go to Project&gt;Properties&gt;Builders.</p></li>
<li><p>Click “New Builder" on the right panel and click “Edit".</p></li>
<li><p>In the new window, click on the “Main" tab and enter the location of
ndk-build.cmd file. It should be something like “...android-ndk-r10b
folder folder/ndk-build.cmd".</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, “Clean" and “build" the project and run it on the Galaxy S6
phone.</p>

<p>If it does not run, libEGL.so and libOpenCL.so will need to be extracted
from the phone and placed at appropriate location. The libEGL.so file
typically resides in the /system/lib/ directory of the smartphone and
libOpenCL.so is typically found in /system/vendor/lib/ directory. The
following commands on windows command prompt can be used to achieve this
task:   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&gt;adb shell<br>
&gt;cd storage/sdcard0<br>
&gt;cp /system/lib/libEGL.so .<br>
&gt;cp /system/vendor/lib/libOpenCL.so .  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you can copy the two library files from the windows explorer to “jni\libs". It should now be ready to run.</p>

<p>In order to compile the VR apk, perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install unity 5.3.4f1 available at <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download">https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the project and go to File&gt;Build Settings&gt;Player
Settings&gt;Publishing settings</p></li>
<li><p>Use some existing keystore or create a new keystore.</p></li>
<li><p>Click build to create the apk.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once both the VR apk and Tracker apk are built, follow the steps
described in Direct Installation section to run the system.</p>

<p>A detailed paper providing the complete algorithm description and theoretical underpinnings will be available shortly.</p>
